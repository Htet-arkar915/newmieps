          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Myanmar Institute of Earth and Planetary Sciences (MIEPS) is a
            pioneering initiative that aims to fill the gap of quality education
            and research opportunities for geoscience students in Myanmar,
            especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. MIEP offers a
            systematic and progressive approach to equip students and lecturers
            with advanced knowledge and skills in geosciences and related
            technologies, and to prepare them for the global standards of
            professional and academic excellence. MIEPS also envisions to expand
            its scope to the broader field of earth and planetary sciences, and
            to conduct cutting-edge research on the earth system in the near
            future. MIEPS is organized by a network of international partners
            from various disciplines, who serve as the part of advisory board of
            the Institute, and local and international Burmese geoscientists and
            researchers, who contribute their expertise and experience to the
            Institute. MIEPS follows short-term, medium-term and long-term plans
            that are consistent with its vision and mission, and that will be
            expanded according to the circumstances.
